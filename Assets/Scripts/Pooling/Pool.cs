    // Dictionaries are basically Lists but with keys (and i hate them)
    // The advantage of a dictionary is in going through the list and checking for a specific element, lookup time, where a list has to compare every item individually, the dictionary uses a hash lookup algorithm, which is fancy words for magic    
    // Basically a list scales O(n) for lookup times, which means that the operation time, O, scales based of the number of elements, N. Which is logical, because the list needs to do one operation for every element
    // But the dictionary, using black magic, has a lookup time of O(1), which means the operation time is always the same, no matter how many elements you need to check
